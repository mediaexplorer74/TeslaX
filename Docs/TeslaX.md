# TeslaX 

TeslaX is my fork of Powerwall Companion X project.

## About Powerwall Companion X

Original "Powerwall Companion X" is a Xamarin Forms - based Android app for monitoring your Tesla Powerwall 2 battery. 

It has similar functionality to the official Tesla app, but it's designed to be 
more of an "always on" dashboard, running on a spare device. 

## My 2 cents

- Windows UWP version added;
- iOS version added (but not tuned by me because of "no iphone"))

## DIY

I'm sharing the source in case anyone wants to improve it or is curious about the underlying APIs.
